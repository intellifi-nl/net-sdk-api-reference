# .NET SDK

The .NET SDK allows [Intellifi](https://intellifi.nl) [Smartspots](https://intellifi.nl/smartspot) to be used as a stand-alone system
without the need for an active internet connection.

## Requirements and prerequisites

Please make sure your setup complies with the following requirements:

System requirements:

- Windows XP or higher (preferably Windows 7 or newer).
- Visual Studio 2010 or higher (preferably Visual Studio 2013 or newer).
- .NET 4.0 or higher.

Prerequisites:

- Administrator/Root privileges on your development machine/server.
- Create an URL reservation through Netsh to prevent having to use administrator rights.
